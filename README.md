# GW2-Raid-Performance
Python script that parses dps.report logs and outputs a .csv of summarised raid performance

# Usage
Paste dps.report logs on `input.txt`. The only requirement is that the logs are separated by whitespace on each sides.
Run `dps_parser.py`. It will prints which player(s) died on which boss(es) on the console.
`output.csv` will be created containing the player performance.

Do **not** use this to be toxic, please.a
